{"name":"Northwind","tagline":"An example of Ultrastructure using ye olde thyme Northwind demonstration","body":"An [Ultrastructure](http://chiralbehaviors.github.io/Ultrastructure) implementation of the venerable Northwind M$ demoware.  This is a mashup of the original order pricing demo presented in the April, 1995 issue of the Communications of the ACM and the Microsoft Northwind retail store demo.  Every software jockey on the planet understands Northwind, so...\r\n\r\nBasically, we get a much richer model of the Northwind retail store AND add order, pricing and shipping logistics workflows so we can actually sell things rather than just report them ;)\r\n\r\nPlease see the [Northwind Wiki](https://github.com/ChiralBehaviors/Northwind/wiki) for more information.\r\n\r\n### Updates\r\n\r\nGot quite a bit done on the modeling front.  We now have [GraphQL API](https://github.com/ChiralBehaviors/Ultrastructure/wiki/Ultrastructure-GraphQL-API) the [JSON-LD API]() mentioned below, and the Java based API.  All these APIs use the same underlying animation code and are just presentations of the underlying Phantasm model.\r\n\r\nUltrastructure as a platform now provides a quite sophisticated capability based security platform.  It isn't built into the Northwind mashup yet, but the base platform now provides all the REST resources necessary to hook into the Phantasm dynamic capability model, as well as providing authentication services for such.  Pretty cool, if I say so myself.  And it's cheap.  The model is also logical and understandable (I know, right?).  So I'll be working on getting that set up next.\r\n\r\nBut the GraphQL API is really the big deal to come out of the last few months of work.  It provides a wicked API for interacting with the underlying Phantasm model of Ultrastructure.  The Northwind Customer Master/Detail page shows just how trivial it is to provide sophisticated data models for the UI tier.\r\n\r\nAlso included is the GraphiQL IDE for GraphQL.  Works with the workspace GraphQL resource, and is pretty awesome to demo.  /workspace-exporer/index.html\r\n\r\n*** \r\n\r\nI finally started tackling the REST API of Ultrastructure.  If there's a minimum bar for a Northwind service, it's at least something REST(ish) that spits out and gobbles up JSON.  So we now have a spiffy new [JSON-LD](http://json-ld.org/) REST api for traversing the graph of Ultrastructure.  The API is called, appropriately, _Phantasm At REST_.  As it turns out, Ultrastructure provides a closed system of self describing linked data that can be represented by RDF.  I know, right?  JSON-LD is the HATEOS JSON version of RDF.  _Phantasm At REST_ is a straight forward and (hopefully obvious) mapping of the Ultrastructure model to data expressed in REST endpoints and JSON-LD data as the interchange.\r\n\r\nWhat I like about JSON-LD is that it's really just JSON data.  The @Context gives you the moral equivalent of schema and the HATEOAS implementation is a natural fit for graph (RDF) data.  I also like how JSON-LD has a bunch of client libraries that don't suck that make it easy to use.\r\n\r\nSo, the upshot is that we now have a crude, browsable web interface for Northwind.  Nothing you'd ever want to use, but it's the base level of REST API interaction with the Ultrastructure system, and thus with Northwind.\r\n\r\nI'll post instructions on the wiki later about how to set this up from a maven command.\r\n\r\nI think I can almost see the day where I'll have all the pieces to make this a really simple, globally federated system.\r\n***\r\nI broke out the general ontology from what is really the test scenario data.  I can argue that US, EURO, etc, need to be in the general, but hey.  Not worrying about a general locations data pack for ultrastructure just yet.\r\n\r\nWhat it does do, though, is provide a much clearer distinction between what is pretty general in the model and what kind of stuff one has to provide in real live scenarios.  And it's no surprise.  Stuff like one's actual products, suppliers, customers, etc.\r\n\r\n***\r\n\r\nI took out all the manual Phantasms, as Northwind is now generating the phantasms from the facets in the Northwind ontology.  This is done with a Maven plugin, and you can see this in the northwind maven module's pom.  You'll have to build at least through generate-sources to see the generated phantasms.  They are generated in target/generated-sources/phantasm directory in the northwind module.\r\n\r\nFrankly, I'm amazed at how simple it has been creating a rather complex model.  Already, we have a rich structure for the system and you can see that the Ultrastructure design discipline naturally creates general abstractions, and how the northwind model could be fully generalized with a little bit of effort.  For the moment, I'm resisting the urge to do that, as I'm more interested in getting a functional demo out the door.  In any event, it'll be interesting to have the refactoring history in git once I do start on generalizing this stuff.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
